# cost-analysis_v2

Project Manager Tool: A repository of tools for analyzing cost and journal data from construction projects

The purpose of this project was to take two inputs, cost data and manhour data and sort it for weekly reports instead of re-creating a new spreadsheet each week. This enabled me to quickly report and track progress on various construction projects and analyze week over week burn on manhours, cost, and subsequently progress.
